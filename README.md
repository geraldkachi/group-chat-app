This spreadsheet tracks tasks - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M018z2wu7U4IQ8zKculYHpvhNN-9NwLpaVvhleoWlyY/edit#gid=0

To collaborate and check status of tasks, go to the spreadsheet. Type what you're working on and add a brief description as well. We can make use of this until we decide if we want to use Trello or Clubhouse or any other app to track tasks. Or not.
